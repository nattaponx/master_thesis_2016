\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to express our gratitude to our supervisors Truong Ho Quang, Ulf Eliasson, Michel Chaudron, and Patricio Pelliccione, who have been challenging us to think in a broader perspective so that we achieve the intended results. We are grateful for the opportunity to do a thesis at Volvo Car Group and that has helped to get a wider understanding of what was happening in the industries. We appreciate the support that we obtained from the employees at the company and most of all, the support of Ulf who was our supervisor from the company. We are thankful for the support he gave us in getting familiar with Elektra and also connect us with different stakeholders.
We would also like to thank all participants that have contributed one way or another in this thesis.
What about the examiner? \todo{[to be filled in]}
